              hash: 4ddde103fb870b36943f01fb0544c76617eef3d8
              body: >
                Devices with public-facing SSH ports can lose SSH access
                permanently

                when systemd's trigger rate limiting stops sshd.socket due to

                connection floods from automated scanners. Since there is no
                built-in

                recovery, headless devices remain unreachable until manual
                intervention.


                Add a systemd timer that checks sshd.socket every 15 minutes and

                restarts it only if Result=trigger-limit-hit — the specific
                state

                systemd sets when TriggerLimitBurst is exceeded. Manual stops
                and

                other failure states are left alone.

                        by migrating

                        of Bluebird's disposer pattern can also be removed at
                        that point.

                        scheduledApply, abortController. Kept applyBlocker and
                        applyInProgress

                        temporarily for applyIntermediateTarget compatibility.
                        Intermediate target

                        functionality to be merged into
                        ExclusiveRunner.withExclusive in next commit.


                        Eliminates race condition where cancel set
                        applyInProgress=false

                        while the aborted apply was still cleaning up, then the
                        recursive

                        re-trigger set it back to true, only for the old finally
                        block to

                        reset it to false again mid-apply.


                        To note is that multiple apply triggers during an
                        in-progress apply

                        queue independently in the semaphore rather than merging
                        into a

                        single scheduledApply (which was the case before). This
                        is fine b/c

                        each queued apply is idempotent so redundant runs are
                        harmless no-ops,

                        so only a slight computational cost.


                        Also removed some tests; ExclusiveRunner unit-tests a
                        lot of the

                        functionality during state apply transitions so these
                        tests are no

                        longer necessary.

                        trigger({ cancel }) now invalidates all pending (queued
                        but not yet

                        running) triggers via AbortController, in addition to

                        aborting the currently running trigger. Pending
                        withExclusive calls

                        are unaffected.


                        withExclusive(fn, { cancel })

                        - aborts the running trigger's signal,

                        - aborts the running exclusive's signal,

                        - calls semaphore.cancel() to reject all pending waiters
                        (both

                        trigger and exclusive) with E_CANCELED.


                        The separation ensures that normal retries (trigger) can
                        cancel stale

                        queued work without interfering with high-priority user
                        operations,

                        while user-initiated operations can cancel everything
                        when needed.

                        This class wraps async-mutex's Semaphore to serialize
                        exclusive

                        function execution. This is the first step toward
                        replacing

                        the current flawed state machine in device-state module.


                        Next commits address running & pending call
                        cancellation.


                        The semaphore subsumes several module-level variables
                        that currently

                        manage apply state:

                        - applyBlocker / applyInProgress: mutual exclusion is
                        built into
                          Semaphore and Semaphore.prototype.isLocked()
                        - scheduledApply: the semaphore queue replaces explicit
                        scheduling


                        Provides two entry points:

                        - trigger(): fire-and-forget at normal priority

                        - withExclusive(): awaitable at high priority, for
                          user-triggered sequences such as restart or purge which
                          take precedence over normal calls through trigger().

                        Both entry points hold the semaphore lock for their
                        duration.


                        The class is generic over FnArgs, so the wrapped
                        function's

                        parameter types are defined by the caller, not baked
                        into the class.

                        The `abortSignal.onabort` callback was never cleaned up
                        after fetch

                        completion, causing the closure to retain references to
                        image/service

                        data.


                        Replace `onabort` property assignment with
                        `addEventListener` and

                        remove the listener in a `finally` block to ensure
                        cleanup on all

                        code paths.

                ... in the extra-firmware and secure-boot tests.

                The kernel-module-build used a Ubuntu base image,
                which no longer works for the RaspberryPi because
                arm32v6 is no longer provided for Ubuntu base images.

                Therefore we're updating the submodule to make use of
                an Alpine base image.

                The variable allSetConfigs is not in this context and
                it appears to be a typo. Replacing it with 'allSetKernelConfigs'
                which appears to be the intended one.

        Add the imx-firmware-mrvl to the IMAGE_INSTALL list.

        Investigation:
        This firmware is already in the CompuLab repository:
        https://github.com/compulab-yokneam/meta-bsp-imx8mp/blob/649a638ee1fbfeef62358bdd7bfaf7f6aa72ccbc/conf/machine/compulab-imx8mp.inc#L67

        This command: ``bitbake-getvar -r balena-image MACHINE_FIRMWARE``
        issued in the ${BUILDDIR} folder does return the imx-firmware-mrvl package.

        Looks like the "MACHINE_FIRMWARE" ignored by BalenaOS build image
        class, as a result the listed packages are not include in the image.

                Some device types apply additional (bootloader-level) rollback
                hooks

                when the abroot script decides to roll back. Right now they keep

                a cusomized fork of the abroot script in the device repo.


                This patch exports the ROOT_PART variable from abroot to
                indicate

                which partition we're about to boot into, as well as a new
                IS_ROLLBACK

                variable. This way all the device types should be able to use
                the same

                abroot and add hooks as separate initrd scripts ordered after
                abroot.

              hash: 49a3c942b852dcc1e96b0bdfded6666c1fd7b369
              body: >
                Right now, abroot is the only script executed in the balena
                bootloader

                so it does everything - find the boot partition, mount it, read
                boot

                configuration, perform A/B selection, and unmount the boot
                partition.


                Long-term, we want to introduce other bootloader scripts that
                read

                the boot configuration and do other things, so we want to have

                an "entry" script that finds and mounts the boot partition, so
                that

                the subsequently executed scripts can just use it.


                This patch splits the abroot script into two - the mountboot
                script

                that finds and mounts the boot partition, and the abroot script,

                that only performs tha A/B selection.

                In commit 3f6a302bf53c6c0a609015c92ff927c7575412d9 we've
                introduced

                a mutex that prevents a race condition between the fsuuidsinit
                script

                changing FS UUIDs and udev creating the by-state symlinks. This
                mutex

                is never unlocked if the FS UUID change fails and leaks out

                from the initrd into the final system, where it blocks

                the 65-resin-update-state udev rule from properly executing. The
                system

                will usually somewhat come up, but fail in weird ways, e.g.
                automounts

                not working.


                This patch unlocks the mutex on failure.

                In order to have the size reduction available for all

                Firmware is compressed using [xz](https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/blob/master/meta-balena-common/classes/balena-linux-firmware.bbclass#L64-L70) by default.

                We thus we need to ensure support for firmware compressed with xz is enabled in the kernel.

        CompuLab provides its own recipe for an ax200 and ax210 Intel wifi:
        https://github.com/compulab-yokneam/meta-compulab-bsp/blob/kirkstone/meta-bsp/recipes-bsp/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_%25.bbappend

        After applying these commits:
        balena-os/meta-balena@f54f198
        balena-os/meta-balena@2ca4f0e

        the linux-firmware-ax210 created empty;
        the linux-firmware-ax200 created with bluetooth firmware files only.

        As a result the iotdin-imx8mp balena-image can't work with the CompuLab
        wifi extension with Intel ax200/ax210.

                        It is possible for logs to be received for a container
                        before we have

                        marked it for attachment and hence cause those logs to
                        be skipped and

                        never sent to the backend. Waiting for a lock before
                        attaching makes

                        this more likely to happen and is unnecessary as we are
                        not directly

                        interacting with/affecting the container and it only

                This recipe is taken from meta-openembedded commit

                33fec4b4f47ae5b86f274c352939437b641e7f8d with the only changes
                being

                that we removed the initd configuration which we don't use, and
                removed

                tag from the GIT URL because yocto spits an error when both tag

                and SRCREV are used at the same time. Remaining tweaks are
                handled

                in bbappend.


                Fixes #3677

                Since 2533a1a we are no longer versioning or tagging balena
                commits

                to the engine, so this renovate package rule no longer applies.


                Going forward, we will manually bump the commit hash unless we
                are

                moving to a new upstream tag.

                This reverts e741dcf6f520765c3345c1e64cfc3f31f5b6a604


                We only use this separate packaging for the Up Board(s) but even
                there we will

                trim this list further but only in that device repository.


                By not splitting the i915 firmware files in multiple packages we
                make sure the

                Generic X86_64 image contains all the i915 firmware.

                        It seems that inspecting a network now shows `IPRange:
                        ""` as part of the IPAM config

                        even if not set. This was interfering with integration
                        testing.

                        The `provisionOrRetry` call was not being awaited to
                        avoid memory leaks

                        due to the recursion, however that can cause other
                        issues if the

                        api-binder is started without properly provisioning.


                        This re-adds the await, but now using a loop to avoid
                        the memory leak.

                        Python3 was bumped to remove distutils, but it's needed
                        for building

                        sqlite3 from source, so add it back via py3-setuptools.

                        The code was incorrectly casting the result of
                        detailedDiff as ServiceConfig,

                        which prevented environment variable redaction from
                        working. This caused

                        sensitive environment variables (API keys, passwords,
                        tokens) to be logged

                        in plain text in debug logs.


                        Fixed by:

                        - Creating a proper DetailedDiff interface for the
                        return type

                        - Correctly redacting environment variables from
                        added/deleted/updated sections

                        - Adding tests to verify environment variables are
                        properly redacted

                This change disables the builkit backend to reduce the final
                binary size by 3-4mb.

                If buildkit is enabled manually via DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 the
                engine will return a clear error that buildkit is not supported.

                This rebases all balenaEngine-specific features on top of the

                upstream Moby v20.10.27 release, cleaning up the previously

                intermingled history of merge commits while preserving full
                commit attribution.


                The patch revision appears to go backwards as previously the
                patch

                value would increase whenever local commits were added. However
                going forward

                we will track the upstream version exactly and only pin commit
                SHAs.

                We used to have the PACKAGE_CLASSES default to package_ipk by
                using the soft ?= assignment.

                However, starting with Scarthgap poky.conf also does a soft
                assignment to package_rpm so we

                end up with that instead.

                We no longer need to override the boot switch from
                the flasher image because we have access to the boot pins
                of the device in question and can control them using a
                relay. This way we can test if the bootswitch detection
                mechanism in u-boot works properly.

                    mv: cannot create regular file '/var/cache/balena-config-vars': File exists

                The cache file may bee generated at the same time by another

                instance of the same helper function. To avoid that,

                we now introduce the lock file

              hash: ca456a422109f6cd4132d0c74fc012ec12a01f91

                The initramfs error addressed by this commit is:

                    zramctl: /dev/zram1: failed to set algorithm: Invalid argument

                zstd is the default algorithm currently used by the zram
                initramfs module,

                which is installed for all device-types. Also, the crypto API
                provides

                the compression algorithms used by the zram kernel module, so
                let's make

                this available for all devices as built-in, so it is accessible
                in the

                initramfs.

                The '+=' operator ensures a space is inserted before appending a
                value,

                however ':append' does not. So let's prepend a space
                consistently

                where ':append' is used.

                        Supervisor has had memory leaks removed since v16.5.1,
                        with latest tested

                        version being v16.7.1. Furthermore, on recent reported
                        instances of memory healthcheck

                        triggering on support, we've snapshotted the heap before
                        & after on devices multiple times

                        without finding any evidence of memory leaks in the
                        snapshots.


                        Therefore, it's hypothesized that the heuristic for
                        determining starting memory may

                        be flawed in that it's not waiting long enough after
                        system startup, or it may

                        run right after garbage collection has happened. Because
                        of the variability and

                        difficulty of ascertaining these factors, we suspect an
                        inaccurate memory

                        baseline may be the cause of the instances of false
                        positives on support.

                        The current target state apply is cancelled when either:

                        - /v1/update is called with cancel: true

                        - A different target state is received from the cloud
                        (with a non-304 status)


                        Following apply cancellation, a target state apply is
                        re-triggered. This ensures

                        that the user can force a device out of a dead-locked
                        situation where a long-running

                        task such as an image fetch fails to cede control back
                        to the Supervisor, which is

                        the behavior observed in an Engine bug with infinite
                        pull retries with a bad network.

                        A contract including extra requirement fields, such as
                        "name" would fail

                        validation. This PR removes any extra fields from the
                        validated contract

                        to prevent services with these extra fields from getting
                        rejected by the

                        contract validation.

              body: |
                There is a board that is slower to get to internet connectivity over WiFi (slower interface
                bring-up, slower initial DNS resolution). Because of this, in cases where we need to update
                the supervisor just after boot (such as after clearing the data partiton by means of deleting
                /mnt/data/remove_me_to_reset and after that rebooting the board) the update-balena-supervisor.service
                will fail because internet connectivity is not yet established.

                To overcome this we make update-balena-supervisor.service depend on a separate target we have defined solely
                for the purpose of waiting for network connectivity. See
                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/commit/a6781d54c6edced457ad916cac3fec9c70d25a0a for details

                        The total flashing time used to be:


                        30 tries × 25 seconds = 750 seconds (12.5 minutes)


                        This used to be on the limit of timeout for slowish SD
                        cards and secure

                        boot flashers that need to boot and re-program


                        It's now double that time:


                        60 tries × 25 seconds = 1,500 seconds (25 minutes)

            - subject: Fail if IOMMU is disabled on secure boot systems
              hash: ecedf68132543a21d906b299c365db7be34abe9f
              body: >
                At this moment we provision secure boot systems without checking

                whether the IOMMU is enabled. With the IOMMU disabled, all PCIe
                cards

                have full DMA access and are able to retrieve the encryption
                keys

                from memory. On some systems this logs an extra event into PCR7.


                This patch makes the OS look for the event in the TPM event log

                and refuse to provision or unlock the disks if the IOMMU is
                disabled.

                This makes the test run check more robust and handles
                cases where we may see unexpected results like more or
                fewer test runs with varying conclusions.

                Github script is also more secure and less prone
                to string processing issues than bash CLI commands.

                When different layers contains template files and no
                --template-path is

                provided, use the highest priority layer.


                This provides a default which is better for automation.

                The existing method of using labels allows for
                Actions Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) attacks
                because we do not associate the label with any commit.

                This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
                comment generated for each workflow run.

                Some device types (generic-armd64) need to run the test

                suites twice for the same base image, once with secure boot

                vars enabled in Leviathan, and once without.


                Rather than run the suites in series, or require building the

                image twice, we can allow the test matrix to define separate
                runs

                for the two modes.

                When evaluating expressions for cancel-in-progress, certain

                For instance, the github.job context is not accessible, as it's
                specific to the running job and not the concurrency group.

                A previous commit added quotes to some of the `balena deploy`
                command args - when $status or $_debug aren't defined, this
                means empty quote gets passed as an arg, making the CLI fail.

                With the update to MM 1.22.0 we have received reports that
                SIM7100E is not functioning correctly.
                Followed up with ModemManager devs and it was discovered the issue
                is related to a PCO setting:

                hook"
              hash: c9544aaf502943f3b492d0a5907f1c1e401c6ac7
              body: >
                cut is sensitive to the amount of delimiter characters when
                parsing

                output, so e.g. an additional space between two elements causes

                every field shift by one index.


                This patch replaces the use of cut by awk, which should be more
                robust.

                This patch adds a set of checks that make sure that the
                partition

                layout is as expected on a system with encrypted disks. Namely
                it

                * Checks that the boot partition is split

                * Checks that it can find the correct amount of encrypted
                partitions

                * Checks that the label on the unlocked filesystem matches the
                label
                  on the encrypted partition
                * Checks that system is not mixing encrypted and unencrypted
                  partitions
                * Checks there are no ambiguities or duplicit partitions

                When this config.json field has a value, the supervisor will
                treat the device as managed and will crash and start to boot
                loop.


                On faster device-types we don't seem to notice and the tests
                pass by chance, but on Pi Zero and similar we consistently see
                ECONNRESET when hitting local SV endpoints.

                We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

                migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto
                builds.


                As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
                bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

                        Users may specify dnsu2t config by including a `dns`
                        field

                        in the `proxy` section of PATCH /v1/device/host-config's
                        body:

                        ```

                        {
                          network: {
                            proxy: {
                              dns: '1.1.1.1:53',
                            }
                          }
                        }

                        ```


                        If `dns` is a string, ADDRESS and PORT are required and
                        should be

                        in the format `ADDRESS:PORT`. The endpoint with error
                        with

                        code 400 if either ADDRESS or PORT are missing.


                        `dns` may also be a boolean. If true, defaults will be
                        configured.

                        If false, the dns configuration will be removed.


                        If `proxy` is patched to empty, `dns` will be removed
                        regardless

                        of its current or input configs, as `dns` depends on an
                        active

                        redsocks proxy to function.

                        The following pattern

                        ```ts

                        async function longRunning() {
                           // do something
                           await setTimeout(delay);
                           await longRunning();
                        }

                        ```


                        Is regularly used for long running operations on the
                        supervisor (e.g.

                        polling target state). We have

                        recently discovered that this pattern can slowly leak
                        memory as it

                        essentially creates an infinite promise chain. Using
                        `void longRunning()` breaks

                        the chain and avoids the issue.


                        This commit fixes all those instances where the pattern
                        was used.

                        The balena logging backend now uses async functions to
                        setup the

                        connection and write messages to the request stream.
                        This adds some

                        backpressure on `log` calls by by the log monitor
                        module, to prevent a

                        very agressive container causing the supervisor to waste
                        CPU cycles just

                        dropping messages.

                        This removes the dependence of the supervisor on the
                        containerLogs

                        database for remembering the last sent timestamp. This
                        commit instead

                        uses the supervisor startup time as the initial time for
                        log retrieval.

                        This might result in some logs missing for services that
                        may start

                        before the supervisor after a boot, or if the supervisor
                        restarts.

                        However this seems like an acceptable trade-off as the
                        current

                        implementation seems to make things worst in resource
                        contrained

                        environments.


                        We'll move storing the last sent timestamp to a better
                        storage medium in

                        a future commit.

                However without a unique name we are unable
                to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

                This change adds a single instance matrix
                to the build job and as a result will append the machine
                name and deploy environment in the job name.

                        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip
                        from the worker had nested retries that led to 30x5 =
                        150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40 mins in the case
                        the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
                        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the
                        nested retries and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins

                With the update to ModemManager version 1.22.0 we now have some
                Quectel modems failing

                to use QMI properly:


                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] power state updated: on

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] (quectel) modem reset detected,

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] (quectel) modem reset detected,
                triggering reprobe

                .

                .

                .

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] failed waiting for final state: Too
                much time waiting to get to a final state

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] failed enabling modem: Operation
                was cancelled

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem1] couldn't start initialization:
                Transaction timed out

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem1] fatal error initializing: Fatal
                error: modem is unusable


                This has been fixed upstream with the 2 patches we backport
                here:


                ModemManager[1139]: [modem0] power state updated: on

                ModemManager[1139]: [modem0] (quectel) continuing without

                This is meant to keep the defaults of `deploy-s3` and

                when building + deploying or a private DT , the check to see if the DT is private fails. This is due to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-api.inc#L424 using this function: https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-lib.inc#L191 - which uses the jenkins deployTo variable to select the correct api url and token.
